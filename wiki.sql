She\'d been called back for additional mammogram images many times and had already undergone two biopsies of suspicious areas in her breasts.</p>\r\n<p>In March 2022, as she waited for a call about the results of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-biopsy/about/pac-20384812\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">breast biopsy</a>, the resident of La Crosse, Wisconsin, felt she already knew what they would be.</p>\r\n<p>\"I had already had that internal conversation that if I was diagnosed, I knew what I would do,\" Kathleen says.</p>\r\n<h2>Not-so-surprising diagnosis</h2>\r\n<p>Kathleen\'s experience with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">breast cancer</a>&nbsp;started long before that afternoon. She was raised in a close-knit family and witnessed 11 family members diagnosed with breast cancer firsthand. She remembers how each responded to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">chemotherapy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">radiation</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-cancer-surgery/about/pac-20385255\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">surgery</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Kathleen contemplated having a prophylactic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mastectomy</a>&nbsp;due to her family history of breast cancer. This surgery removes breast tissue to lower the chances of getting breast cancer in the future.</p>\r\n<p>While considering this option, the then 52-year-old scheduled a routine&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mammogram</a>. It came back clear, but she wasn\'t convinced. At the urging of her sister, Kathleen discussed her concerns and family history with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/steven-perkins-do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Steven Perkins, D.O.</a>, her primary care physician. Together they decided that a follow-up&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-mri/about/pac-20384809\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MRI scan</a>&nbsp;would be necessary to give her peace of mind.</p>\r\n<p>Kathleen\'s suspicions were correct. The MRI showed a small&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/breast-lumps/basics/definition/sym-20050619\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lump</a>&nbsp;and swollen lymph nodes, leading to a sonogram and another biopsy. Kathleen was at work when she got the phone call from surgeon&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/m-kathleen-christian-md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">M. Kathleen Christian, M.D.</a>, who explained the biopsy confirmed that she had early stage 1A breast cancer.</p>\r\n<p>\"When you get breast cancer, it\'s hard to understand the complexity of it. Dr. Christian did a really good job explaining it to me,\" says Kathleen. \"I took a deep breath, but I already knew I was going to be as aggressive as I needed to be because I have kids.\"</p>\r\n<p>Kathleen learned that she had a \"well-behaved tumor,\" but an invasive one, so treatment would be required.</p>\r\n<p>\"Thankfully, Kathleen had been diligent about regular breast cancer screenings. Due to her obtaining recommended breast imaging, the cancer was caught early,\" says Dr. Christian. \"She had several options on how to best treat her cancer based on her desires and risks related to her family history. She has an excellent prognosis, and that\'s what we want for our patients.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Taking an aggressive approach</h2>\r\n<p>Dr. Christian explained different treatment approaches to Kathleen, including a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumpectomy/about/pac-20394650\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lumpectomy</a>&nbsp;to surgically remove only the concerning areas in her breast.</p>\r\n<p>\"We talked about a lumpectomy, but I knew that wouldn\'t give me peace of mind,\" says Kathleen. \"I was a high risk, and I knew that a mastectomy was the way I needed to go.</p>\r\n<p>A bilateral mastectomy would remove the cancer and both of Kathleen\'s breasts. She wasn\'t interested in reconstruction with implants or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire/services-and-treatments/plastic-and-reconstructive-surgery/breast-services/breast-reconstruction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">flap procedure</a>&nbsp;but didn\'t like the idea of being completely flat-chested after surgery. She says she feared a drastically changed profile would be a constant cancer reminder for her and her family.</p>\r\n<h2>Goldilocks: Not too little or too much</h2>\r\n<p>That\'s why Kathleen was relieved when Dr. Christian explained she might be a good candidate for a new option: a Goldilocks procedure.</p>\r\n<p>\"Even with hearing and watching so many family members on their cancer journeys, I\'d never heard of this option before,\" Kathleen says.</p>\r\n<p>The Goldilocks procedure is performed after a mastectomy to remove unhealthy breast tissue. Then, the remaining fatty tissue and skin are formed into a breast mound that gives some shape and definition to the breast. The operation is typically used in patients with larger and heavier breasts, but it can be used in some patients with smaller breasts.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<figure><img style=\"height: auto; width: 325px;\" src=\"https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/64bf9b8fff067424/uploads/2024/01/goldlilocks-procedure-illustration.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px\" srcset=\"https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/64bf9b8fff067424/uploads/2024/01/goldlilocks-procedure-illustration.jpg 325w, https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/64bf9b8fff067424/uploads/2024/01/goldlilocks-procedure-illustration-244x300.jpg 244w\" alt=\"\" width=\"325\" height=\"400\"></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>It\'s called Goldilocks because it represents a middle-of-the-road option for patients, explains plastic surgeon&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/matthew-sherrill-md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Matthew Sherrill, M.D.</a></p>\r\n<p>\"It\'s an option that isn\'t too extreme one way or the other. It\'s halfway between mastectomy with a flat-chest appearance and full reconstruction with implants, expanders or a flap procedure,\" says Dr. Sherrill.</p>\r\n<p>The procedure also is good for women who can\'t have or aren\'t interested in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-options-for-breast-reconstruction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reconstruction</a>&nbsp;immediately after mastectomy.</p>\r\n<p>\"This technique is often used in patients with other medical comorbidities who may not be good candidates for an immediate breast reconstruction because of the potential complications,\" says Dr. Sherrill. \"The Goldilocks operation is sometimes the only step in the process, or it can be a starting block for future reconstruction. Reshaping the breast skin at the time of the mastectomy with the Goldilocks operation gives patients a template or a canvas to undergo future breast reconstruction if they desire.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Collaboration for better results</h2>\r\n<p>Drs. Christian and Sherrill explain that a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to breast cancer surgery and reconstruction leads to better patient outcomes and experiences.</p>\r\n<p>\"The operation is most successful when done as a team involving the surgeons, physician assistants and nursing staff in educating the patient before the surgery, coordinating the operation and supporting the patient during recovery,\" says Dr. Sherrill.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Christian applauds the work of the dedicated breast cancer team at Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse.</p>\r\n<p>\"We work closely together and meet regularly at our breast tumor conferences to discuss the best options available for treatment,\" she says. \"We then individualize recommendations based on the patient\'s staging, tumor characteristics and what they want for surgical outcomes.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Surgery and beyond</h2>\r\n<p>In June 2022, Kathleen underwent a bilateral mastectomy to remove both breasts and her cancer. At the same time, she underwent the Goldilocks procedure to form breast mounds from her existing tissue and skin. The surgery was a success, and soon she was recovering at home.</p>\r\n<p>Kathleen returned to work part time three weeks after surgery and soon returned to the sidelines to cheer on her sons\' sports teams.</p>\r\n<p>After the surgery, her risk of future breast cancer was low, so no additional treatment was necessary.</p>\r\n<p>Recovery went well but wasn\'t completely smooth. Over a holiday weekend, she developed hives and a rash due to a previously unknown allergy to adhesives and latex. Dr. Sherrill called her that weekend to discuss her symptoms and get her the treatment she needed for allergy relief. She hasn\'t had any other allergy issues.</p>\r\n<p>Since then, Kathleen decided to have additional reconstruction procedures to give her breasts more fullness and shape without implants or more extensive flap surgeries.</p>\r\n<p>About one year after her surgery, Kathleen says she feels well and confident that she made the right treatment choices. She also feels secure with her healthcare team.</p>\r\n<p>\"Nobody ever said, \'You\'ve got this.\' It was always a team approach, and everyone said, \'We\'ve got this,\'\" she says. \"Cancer is a scary word, and nobody wants cancer.

The first topic of confusion that needs to be cleared up is powerlifting contains zero power movements. None. To be clear, in the world of strength and conditioning, &ldquo;power&rdquo; and &ldquo;strength&rdquo; are two distinct variables.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Power&rdquo; describes the ability to move weight relative to time. In other words, it refers to lifting fast. The most obvious choice to illustrate power movements are the&nbsp;<a title=\"what are olympic lifts\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/olympic-lifts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Olympic lifts</a>, the snatch and clean. In these movements, the athlete must generate a lot of force quickly to propel an object in the air. Another typical example is jumping (have you ever tried to jump slow?).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, &ldquo;strength&rdquo; simply refers to the ability to move a maximal amount of weight. As this is the goal, these movements don&rsquo;t move fast. Think big movements like the squat, bench press, and deadlift.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are some other physiological differences and alterations to training variables, but the easiest way to think about these is that &ldquo;power&rdquo; is fast strength and &ldquo;strength&rdquo; is slow strength.</p>\r\n<p>So now that we know powerlifting isn&rsquo;t really powerlifting, what is it? As stated above, a&nbsp;powerlifting training program&nbsp;consists of lifting maximal weight across 3 different movements. Collectively, these movements are known as &ldquo;The Big Three&rdquo; in a powerlifting program.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>THE BIG THREE OF A POWERLIFTING PROGRAM:</strong></h3>\r\n<p>You have probably heard the term &ldquo;The Big Three&rdquo; before, and it comes from the sport of powerlifting. These are the 3 biggest movements that are a sign of pure strength and always included in a powerlifting workout routine.</p>\r\n<p>Sure, there are some arguments on if these are the &ldquo;best,&rdquo; but we&rsquo;re not here for semantics. These three movements within a powerlifting training program&nbsp;allow you to move a lot of weight and are great predictors of overall absolute strength. These movements are:</p>\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\r\n<li>The Squat</li>\r\n<li>The Bench Press</li>\r\n<li>The Deadlift</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2><strong>WHAT&rsquo;S THE OBJECTIVE OF POWERLIFTING?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>In the sport of powerlifting, the only goal is to lift the most weight you can in these 3 big lifts. Nothing else matters. The only factor that must be addressed is bodyweight as athletes compete in weight classes.</p>\r\n<p>To be clear, this has nothing to do with&nbsp;<a title=\"aesthetic workout\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/aesthetic-physique-workout-routine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aesthetics</a>; it&rsquo;s merely to keep things as fair as possible as it obviously doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have a 150lb athlete compete against a 200lbs athlete. However, some athletes may perform better by competing in a lower weight class while others perform better when moved up.</p>\r\n<p>In a competition, you will have 3 attempts to execute one lift at a time with the heaviest lift going towards your total.&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of the heaviest attempts of all three lifts are added together and that&rsquo;s your score. The order of these exercises is: the squat, the bench press, and the deadlift. Generally, this is how the lifts will look in a meet.</p>\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\r\n<li>The first lift will be heavy but something known as an &ldquo;everyday max&rdquo;. Simply put, this is a weight that you 100% know you can get any day of the week. The purpose of this lift is to just get some points on the board.</li>\r\n<li>The second lift will be pushing the envelope some. This is closer to your &ldquo;true max&rdquo; which is a lift you can hit if everything is going well.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>The third lift is usually reserved for a&nbsp;<a title=\"PR meaning in fitness\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/personal-record-pr-in-gym-what-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PR</a>. If you miss it, you still have the weight from the second lift, so it&rsquo;s no loss.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>While a full meet will include all 3 exercises, some other powerlifting competitions may only include one or two lifts. Plus, there are dozens of federations that all have different rules on how they hold meets. Regardless, that&rsquo;s the basics of powerlifting.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"height: auto; width: auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1633/7705/files/powerlifting_program_480x480.jpg?v=1633942069\" alt=\"powerlifting program\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\r\n<h2><strong>THE BEST POWERLIFTING PROGRAM&nbsp;FOR PURE STRENGTH</strong></h2>\r\n<p>I\'m going to first show you the best powerlifting programs, and then I recommend continuing to read the remaining sections, as I break down training variables and exercise how-tos that are essential for these powerlifting routines.</p>\r\n<p>For example, you\'ll notice in the powerlifting workout routine below I mention a 5/3/1 format. Stay tuned afterward so I can explain how to follow that format.</p>\r\n<p>A quick note about this powerlifting routine: Every day is going to have the same order of variables, it will only be the lifts that change. Also, use your weights&nbsp;to customize this powerlifting program to&nbsp;your fitness level.&nbsp;You can make it a beginner program by using lighter weights (still achieving the suggested RM),&nbsp;whereas more&nbsp;advanced programs&nbsp;will use heavier weights.</p>\r\n<p>Without further ado, your&nbsp;free powerlifting program awaits!</p>\r\n<h3><strong>POWERLIFTING PROGRAM SESSION 1:</strong></h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<table style=\"width: 824px;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">\r\n<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">\r\n<p><strong>Sets x Reps/Intensity</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">\r\n<p>Warm-Up &amp;

Therefore, if an exercise isn&rsquo;t going to support one of these 3 movements, you&rsquo;re not going to do it. With this concept in mind, this powerlifting program is going to use a 4-day split.</p>\r\n<p>Three of the days in this powerlifting program will consist of the squat, bench press, deadlift, and variations. The fourth powerlifting program day will consist of accessory work (aka assistance exercises) to support the 3 main movements and support an all-around program. By support, we mean improve those lifts.</p>\r\n<p>Simple yet effective.</p>\r\n<p>The three main lift days in the powerlifting program will utilize a quasi-form of DUP, or daily undulating periodization. DUP is a form of&nbsp;<a title=\"periodization\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/periodization-training-models\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">periodization</a>&nbsp;that alters the intensity or focused training variable daily rather than a traditional block program. The three main lifts and their variations will rotate through these three training variables over the three days (that&rsquo;s a lot of three&rsquo;s in your powerlifting workout schedule). Therefore, each lift and its variations will hit every training variable at some point during the&nbsp;powerlifting workout program.</p>\r\n<p>Below is how that looks like with the lifts:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n<li>Power/Max Velocity (Lift Variation)</li>\r\n<li>Strength (Main Lift)</li>\r\n<li>Hypertrophy/Volume (Lift Variation)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Using a DUP, either traditional or modified,&nbsp;have been found to be extremely effective in various powerlifting programs (<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2016/03000/Modified_Daily_Undulating_Periodization_Model.24.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>). It allows you to train every aspect of the spectrum simultaneously which should mitigate fatigue and allow for continual gains. Plus, it&rsquo;s just more fun to train with some variety in your program.</p>\r\n<p>The 4th training session&nbsp;of the powerlifting workout&nbsp;will include smaller exercises and isolation work. The main focus of these is for mobility, injury prevention, and strengthening the secondary muscles involved in the main lift.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>TEST WEEK FOR YOUR POWERLIFTING PROGRAM</strong></h3>\r\n<p>In order to run an effective powerlifting program, you will need to find your training 1-rep max for each of the three lifts. So, what&rsquo;s a training 1-rep max? A training 1-rep max is a maximum load you can confidently lift any day of the week. It&rsquo;s definitely tough, but you are 100% sure you can do it.</p>\r\n<p>This differs from a &ldquo;true max&rdquo; in that a &ldquo;true max&rdquo; is a load you have purposely trained for.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, it&rsquo;s a freak accident when the stars aligned and everything just went right.</p>\r\n<p>We want to use a training 1-rep max because we want to be sure the number is low enough to give a suitable number to start with in this powerlifting training program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, trainees start too heavy on a program which leaves them nowhere to go. That being, you&rsquo;re not straining so hard you\'re popping blood vessels; you&rsquo;re merely looking for an approximate number.</p>\r\n<p>Now that we got that out of the way, here&rsquo;s a workout routine to find your 1-rep max, which you\'ll need to know for this&nbsp;powerlifting workout program.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n<li>Perform a proper warmup that includes a general warmup, specific warmup, mobility, and muscle activation (see below).</li>\r\n<li>Perform 2 sets of 10 using only the bar.</li>\r\n<li>Place 50% of your estimate 1-rep max and perform 1 set of 10 reps.</li>\r\n<li>Add 50% of that weight (so now at 75% of your estimated 1-rep max) and perform 1 set of 5 reps.</li>\r\n<li>Add 20% of that weight (now at 90% of your estimated 1-rep max) and perform 1 set of 2 reps.</li>\r\n<li>Now add 5% of that weight (now at 95%) and perform 1-rep.</li>\r\n<li>Now, continue to add weight performing only 1-rep. The jumps will depend on the weights you have available as well as how hard you think it feels.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You will want to wait 3 minutes between each set up to step 5 (90% est 1-rep max) and then 5 minutes thereafter for all of these sets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>COMMON POWERLIFTING TRAINING PROGRAM MISTAKE: STARTING TOO HEAVY</strong></h4>\r\n<div role=\"cell\" data-ui-name=\"Flex\">\r\n<div data-ui-name=\"Box\">\r\n<div data-ui-name=\"Flex\">\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div role=\"cell\" data-ui-name=\"Flex\">\r\n<div data-ui-name=\"Box\">\r\n<div data-ui-name=\"Flex\">\r\n<div data-ui-name=\"Box\">\r\n<div data-ui-name=\"Flex\">\r\n<div data-ui-name=\"Tooltip\" aria-haspopup=\"false\">\r\n<div data-ui-name=\"Flex\" data-at=\"intent-badge-commercial\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>You are not killing yourself on the experimental week of your powerlifting workout program. The purpose is to get used to the lifts and get a starting point. You are way better off starting 10-20 lbs to light then 10-20 lbs too heavy.&nbsp;You are going to work into it so don&rsquo;t rush it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"height: auto; width: auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1633/7705/files/powerlifting_routine_480x480.jpg?v=1633941978\" alt=\"best free powerlifting programs\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\r\n<h3><strong>INCLUDING&nbsp;DIFFERENT TRAINING DAYS OF THE WEEK IN YOUR POWERLIFTING PROGRAMS</strong></h3>\r\n<p>As mentioned above, each of the main lifts in this powerlifting training program&nbsp;will train 3 different aspects of performance on different days. Before listing all of the exercises, we will go over the details of what the goal is for each day within your powerlifting programs.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>1) POWER/MAX VELOCITY IN YOUR POWERLIFTING PROGRAM:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The purpose of this day in your powerlifting training program&nbsp;is to increase force and power output. While above, we mentioned that strength and power are actually two distinct variables, there is also overlap as they both rely on improving the function of the neuromuscular system.&nbsp; Still, if you are able to generate high levels of force and improve your force development rate, you will be able to move weight easier when you train for strength.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That being said, this day will implore two tactics for their lifts:&nbsp;<strong>resistance bands</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>maximal intent</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Attaching elastic bands to a barbell is a form of variable resistance that aims to accommodate the strength curve that exists when we lift. The strength curve simply refers to the phenomena where our body&rsquo;s strength can vary depending on our biomechanics and joint angles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For example, during the squat, we are weakest at the bottom of the lift. However, as we begin to stand and extend our joints we become stronger. Therefore, theoretically, we don&rsquo;t train the muscles optimally through an entire movement using a constant load as the load is determined by our weakest position. Using an elastic band for squats addresses this as the band will begin to stretch as we stand causing more resistance. Using variable resistance is a very powerful tactic to increase strength, and numerous studies have shown elastic bands&nbsp;to produce greater force outputs (<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2016/12000/electromyographic_comparison_of_squats_using.23.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"powerlifting bands\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/products/power-bands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Set For Set offers extremely high-quality Power Bands</a>&nbsp;that would be perfect for your banded movements on this day. There are 5 different bands to choose from, with loads ranging from 10-170lbs. You can buy them separately or buy a package to save some money.</p>\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\r\n<li>Yellow: 10-35lbs&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Black: 30-60lbs&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Blue: 40-80lbs&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Green: 50-125lbs</li>\r\n<li>Gray: 65-170lbs&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><a title=\"bands for powerlifting\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/products/power-bands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"height: auto; width: auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1633/7705/files/resistance_bands_208f81ea-a964-422a-8896-8d97cd2130a9_240x240.jpg?v=1633942363\" alt=\"powerlifting\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\r\n<p>And for additional options, make sure you check out our article on the&nbsp;<a title=\"best resistance bands\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/best-resistance-bands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">11 Best Resistance Bands</a>!</p>\r\n<p>When choosing what band to use in these&nbsp;powerlifting programs, you will want the bands to account for 20-40% of the total load. There can be some variance as you will have a limited number of bands and weight plates to choose from, so you&rsquo;ll be ok as long as the total percentage is somewhere between there.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You notice that the load of the band has a range. When adding the weight of the resistance bands to the total load, you are going to want to add the highest number. For example, if adding the yellow resistance band to the total weight, you would add its max resistance of 35lbs by two, since you will use two bands. Therefore, if you add two yellow bands, you will have added 70lbs.</p>\r\n<p>Remember that you only have so many combinations with bands and weight plates so the % may not be exact; you just want an approximate. You may even find that 70lbs is higher than 40% of your lifts; if so, go ahead and use it anyway and adjust the weights as necessary. As usual, spend a little bit of time to find a suitable band or combination of bands but don&rsquo;t stress all day over getting it exact, particularly for those using this as a&nbsp;beginner powerlifting program.</p>\r\n<p>To get a more detailed explanation of using resistance bands for resistance training, check out this&nbsp;awesome piece from Set For Set:&nbsp;<a title=\"strength training resistance bands\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/strength-training-101-how-to-use-resistance-bands-for-quick-gains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to use bands for barbell exercises</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The other tactic we will use on this day is the concept of&nbsp;<strong>maximal intent</strong>. This basically means that when you lift, you will focus on pushing as hard as you can. Think about when you throw a ball or perform an Olympic movement where you complete the lift as powerfully as you can; same idea. As power is determined by the speed of a lift, this should theoretically produce greater power and force output. Further, this intent should cause demand for higher activation of the muscles. While there haven&rsquo;t been many studies on this concept, the theory behind it is scientifically solid, and the experiments that have been performed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17461391.2014.905987\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">show promising results</a>.</p>\r\n<p>To improve power, you are going to use a lighter load.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, power is related to time so using a lighter load that can be pushed faster will generate a higher force output. This exact load will vary slightly for movements, but it lays somewhere around 60-70%1RM.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While this is light, you are going to use low reps. This is because you want every rep in your powerlifting program to be conducted with 100% effort. If you are fatigued, creating maximum power will be impossible, making the training useless. But don&rsquo;t worry, you will make it up with high sets.&nbsp;Every exercise is going to use a 6X3 rep scheme with 2:00-3:00 rest.</p>\r\n<p>Even&nbsp;intermediate and advanced lifters&nbsp;can add a very small amount to the bar each week for progressive overload, such as 5lbs. If you\'re using this as a&nbsp;beginner powerlifting program and following a linear progression program, you may even want to start smaller at 2.5 pounds (if your gym has that option).&nbsp;However, the progressive overload from here will ideally come from faster barbell speed. This is obviously hard to measure without the correct equipment so you&rsquo;ll just need to do your best. You can also videotape yourself to see how you look.</p>\r\n<p><em>Related:&nbsp;<a title=\"maximal intent strength training\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/velocity-based-training\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Complete Guide to Velocity-Based Training for Maximal Intent</a></em></p>\r\n<h4><strong>2) STRENGTH TRAINING IN YOUR POWERLIFTING PROGRAM:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The strength day in your powerlifting programs&nbsp;is to build strength in the competition movement. On your powerlifting strength program day,&nbsp;you are going to perform the traditional movements as is with some small caveats. For the squat and bench press in these&nbsp;powerlifting programs, you will give a full 1-second pause at the bottom. This serves two purposes:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n<li>Lessen the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC), thus demanding more output</li>\r\n<li>Prepare for a powerlifting competition as they require a full stop after the descent of the bar before pushing back up.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To progress on your powerlifting strength day, you will use a&nbsp;<a title=\"531 workout routine\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/531-workout-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5/3/1</a>&nbsp;rep scheme. What this means is that the first week of the powerlifting workouts, you will train with 5 reps, the second week you will use 3 reps, the third week you will use 1 rep, and the fourth week will be a deload. In total, the rep scheme with load will look like this:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n<li>Week 1: 5x5 @ 85% 1RM</li>\r\n<li>Week 2: 3X3 @ 90% 1RM</li>\r\n<li>Week 3: 5X1 @ 95% 1RM</li>\r\n<li>Week 4: 5X5 @50% 1RM</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For each set (other than the deload) you will rest 3:00-4:00.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>3) HYPERTROPHY/VOLUME TRAINING IN YOUR POWERLIFTING PROGRAM:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The main purpose of this day in your powerlifting program is merely to get in some high-volume work. These lifts will be slight variations in an attempt to target a primary mover.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On this day within the powerlifting programs, you will use a load of 60-70% at RPE 7 to judge your training volume.&nbsp;<a title=\"RPE\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/rpe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RPE</a>&nbsp;is a form of auto-regulation that uses a scale of 1-10 to guide your lifting based on how hard it feels. An RPE 7 means that something is getting hard but you could easily do more. The best way to explain it is to imagine lifting you 10RM seven times.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://formacion.ferugby.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Monitoring-Exercise-Intensity-During-Resistance-Training_RPE.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RPE is an awesome way to manage fatigue&nbsp;</a>so that you don&rsquo;t overexert yourself. Again, the purpose of this powerlifting workout day is just to get volume in, not exhaust you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Progressive overload from here will simply come from ideally adding more reps to sets within these&nbsp;powerlifting programs. However, this again is based on RPE so don&rsquo;t add reps if you feel fatigued.</p>\r\n<p>You will use a rest period of 2:00 within this powerlifting plan.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>THE BEST EXERCISES FOR POWERLIFTING&nbsp;PROGRAMS</strong></h2>\r\n<p>So now you know the best powerlifting program for building strength.&nbsp;Next up is examining the most&nbsp;effective exercises for producing massive power within these&nbsp;powerlifting programs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to go through each of the main lifts and the variations you will use in this powerlifting program.&nbsp;Then,&nbsp;we&rsquo;ll go through the exercises you&rsquo;ll use on the fourth day of our&nbsp;powerlifting programs&nbsp;to address specific muscles and tissues vital for optimal performance.</p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s do this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>SQUAT AND SQUAT VARIATIONS</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Here\'s a look at all of the squat variations you\'ll need to master for your powerlifting program.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>1) POWER/MAX VELOCITY SESSION: BANDED BACK SQUAT</strong></h4>\r\n<p>For your squat power/max velocity session, you&rsquo;re going to perform banded squats with elastic bands. When performing squats, the optimal load for power occurs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17277599/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">when using around 56%1RM</a>. For the sake of simplicity with our&nbsp;powerlifting programs,&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll just use 60%1RM for your total load.</p>\r\n<p>Again, you will want to use resistance bands to account for 20-40% of the total load. For example, if your max squat is 200lbs, 120lbs is 60%. 20-40% of 120lbs would be 24lbs-48lbs. You only have the yellow bands which add up to 70lbs so you would just use that. Therefore, you would use 50lbs of resistance from bars and plates and 70lbs of resistance from the bands.</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme: 6x3 @ 70% w/ 2:00-3:00 rest</p>\r\n<h4><strong>2) STRENGTH SESSION: BACK SQUAT</strong></h4>\r\n<p>For strength in this powerlifting program, you&rsquo;re going to simply use the back squat, just like in competition. The purpose of this day, other than obviously get better at squats, is to optimize the training from the other two sessions. Therefore, this is an important session as this will allow you to maximize your potential.</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme: 5/3/1 @ 85%/90%/95% w/ 3:00-4:00 rest</p>\r\n<h4><strong>3) HYPERTROPHY/VOLUME SESSION: SAFETY SQUAT BAR W/ HOLD</strong></h4>\r\n<p>For the&nbsp;volume day in your powerlifting training, you&rsquo;re going to perform squats with a&nbsp;<a title=\"safety squat bar benefits\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/safety-squat-bar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">safety squat bar</a>&nbsp;(SSB). Using an SSB is a great option to add in volume while saving your back. There&rsquo;s nothing dangerous about back squats if you do them properly. However, in this program, you&rsquo;ll be doing them three times a week. This volume can be a lot for some people to handle; actually, it can be a lot for anyone to handle if you&rsquo;re training hard.</p>\r\n<p>The SSB will allow you to still get in volume with similar body mechanics while saving your back. However, you&rsquo;ll take that safety measure one step further by setting up another barbell at about chest level. After unracking the SSB, you will grab the barbell and use it for support as you perform your lifts.</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme: 3XRPE7 @ 70% w/ 2:00 rest</p>\r\n<p><em>Related:&nbsp;<a title=\"squats\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/squat-how-to-muscles-worked-benefits-variations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Complete Guide to Squatting</a></em></p>\r\n<h3><strong>BENCH PRESS AND BENCH PRESS VARIATIONS</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Prepare for some&nbsp;serious pressing while following this powerlifting routine.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>1) POWER/MAX VELOCITY SESSION: BOARD PRESS W/ BANDS</strong></h4>\r\n<p>For the bench press max velocity session, you&rsquo;re going to use bands with the board press. The board press is a variation where a board of desired height is placed on the chest, thus limiting the range of motion. However, it&rsquo;s main purpose is to address sticking points in the bench press.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Because you are not coming down to a full stretch, the advantage of the stretch-shortening cycle will be limited. You will be required to generate enough force to get through the sticking point in limited space. One common sticking point is a few inches off the chest and this is the area that this movement will address.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You are going to want to use a board that&rsquo;s a couple of inches thick so that it&rsquo;s just below this area. Doing so is going to teach you to generate enough force to be able to push through this point.</p>\r\n<p>You are also going to implement the bands as well. However, because the ROM is a bit smaller, use 70%1RM with 20-40% load from bands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme: 6x3 @ 70% w/ 2:00-3:00 rest</p>\r\n<h4><strong>2) STRENGTH SESSION: BENCH PRESS</strong></h4>\r\n<p>No good powerlifting programs are without the bench press. The strength session is going to look very similar to the squat strength session, except you&rsquo;ll be performing the bench press. Obviously. Therefore, the same rules are going to apply as when the barbell hits your chest, you will pause for 1 second before pushing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme: 5/3/1 @ 85%/90%/95% w/ 3:00-4:00 rest</p>\r\n<h4><strong>3) HYPERTROPHY/VOLUME SESSION: TRICEPS BOARD PRESS (CLOSE GRIP) W/ BANDS</strong></h4>\r\n<p>For the bench press hypertrophy session in this powerlifting program, you are going to use the triceps board press or close grip bench press, and utilize bands again and board again. While everyone associates the bench press with the chest, the triceps actually play a significant role as they are the primary movers from midway to lockout.</p>\r\n<p>To be clear, the triceps are involved in the entire movement, it&rsquo;s just this section where their role increases. Regardless, if your triceps suck, you&rsquo;re not going to complete the bench press. You don&rsquo;t want that to happen, which is why you&rsquo;re going to build the triceps muscle up with this movement.</p>\r\n<p>When you choose a board, you want to use one that places the bar just below midway of the lift. As mentioned above, this is where the&nbsp;<a title=\"triceps barbell\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/barbell-tricep-exercises-workouts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">triceps</a>&nbsp;start to become a major mover.</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme: 3xRPE7 @ 70% w/ 2:00 rest</p>\r\n<p><em>Related:&nbsp;<a title=\"bench press\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/bench-press-how-to-benefits-muscles-worked-best-variations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Complete Guide to Bench Pressing</a></em></p>\r\n<h3><strong>DEADLIFT AND DEADLIFT VARIATIONS</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Deadlifts play a key role in effective powerlifting programs, so make sure to read through this key information.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>1) POWER/MAX VELOCITY SESSION: BANDED 2&rdquo; DEFICIT DEADLIFT</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The 2&rdquo; deficit deadlift has you stand on a 2&rdquo; block when performing this movement. Being a little bit higher will alter the biomechanics and lengthen the range of motion, both of which will make the movement harder. However, harder is a good thing as it will require much more effort to get the weight off the ground. Then when you return to the ground, the weight is going to feel easier.</p>\r\n<p>One major&nbsp;<a title=\"deficit deadlift benefits\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/deficit-deadlifts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">benefit of the deficit deadlift</a>&nbsp;is that it addresses the hardest part of the lift for most people; getting the weight off the ground. Another bonus is the deficit deadlift is going to train you to use leg drive. A common error with beginners&nbsp;is they pull too much and neglect to push. This means that they neglect to use their quads to push down into the ground when they pull the weight off the floor. However, as the deficit deadlift will require higher flexion in the hips and knees, the contribution of the posterior muscles will be lessened. This leaves the quads to pick up the slack.</p>\r\n<p>After training with deficit deadlifts, you will have:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n<li>Improved the strength of your hamstrings and gluteus maximus</li>\r\n<li>Increased your power output and force production</li>\r\n<li>Improved hip extension</li>\r\n<li>Learned to engage your quadriceps correctly.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All of these factors will contribute to increasing your 1RM.</p>\r\n<p>The deficit deadlift is harder than conventional so use 60% 1RM.</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme: 6x3 @ 60% w/ 2:00-3:00 rest</p>\r\n<h4><strong>2) STRENGTH SESSION: DEADLIFT</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The traditional deadlift is a staple in powerlifting programs. Nothing fancy here. Just the king of exercises.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme: 5/3/1 @ 85%/90%/95% w/ 3:00-4:00 rest</p>\r\n<h4><strong>3) HYPERTROPHY/VOLUME SESSION: BARBELL ROMANIAN DEADLIFT</strong></h4>\r\n<p>For the hypertrophy/volume session in your powerlifting training, you&rsquo;re going to use the&nbsp;<a title=\"barbell romanian deadlift\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/romanian-deadlift-rdl-workout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">barbell Romanian deadlift</a>. While the deficit deadlifts will target the quads, the Romanian deadlift will target the gluteus maximus and hamstrings: in fact, it&rsquo;s&nbsp;one of the best posterior chain exercises&nbsp;you can do (<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2014/06000/Muscle_Activation_During_Various_Hamstring.11.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>). This is awesome as the deadlift obviously depends on these muscles for maximum strength.</p>\r\n<p>When compared to the deadlift, the Romanian deadlift tends to be a much better option for muscle hypertrophy regardless. This is mainly attributed to the range of motion, increased muscle tension, and ability to perform higher volumes. The deadlift is an awesome movement, but generally speaking, it&rsquo;s not the best movement for high volume.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is the only exercise you&rsquo;ll need to discover a good weight to use rather than base it off your 1RM. Find a weight that you can do 12-15 times. You&rsquo;ll work into it so it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a little light.</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme: 3x12-15 reps w/ 2:00 rest</p>\r\n<p><em>Related:</em></p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n<li><em><a title=\"deadlifting\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/benefits-of-deadlifts-variations-muscles-worked\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Complete Guide to Deadlifting</a></em></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"deadlift barbell\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/what-is-a-deadlift-bar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>What is a Deadlift Bar?</em></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>FOR SESSIONS 1-3: THE BARBELL ROLLOUT</strong></h3>\r\n<p>For all three sessions, you are going to train your core with barbell rollouts at the end of the session.&nbsp;The barbell rollout is the single greatest exercise&nbsp;to strengthen your core (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ptj/article/86/5/656/2857416?login=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>).</p>\r\n<p>Every muscle in the core is activated to a significant degree to brace the spine and torso during the movement. As the core is heavily engaged in all of the above movements, you need to be sure yours can take the beating. Therefore, perform the barbell rollout after each exercise.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>SESSION 4 (ACCESSORY WORK)</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The fourth powerlifting session will be smaller exercises and some isolation work to hit some specific areas, improve mobility, and provide an effective all-around program. Further, none of these movements are going to be performed with a heavy load. You do not want this day to impact the training of the other three days. Regardless, here are the movements you&rsquo;re going to perform. While the movements look like a lot, you will move through them much quicker than the first three days as you&rsquo;re only resting 1:00-1:30 between each set.</p>\r\n<p>Further, progressive overload for these movements will come from increasing reps in the range given, and then adding weight. You then increase the reps to the top of the range again and add more weight.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>1) BARBELL HIP THRUST:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The barbell&nbsp;<a title=\"hip thrust\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/hip-thrusts-muscles-worked\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hip thrust</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;perhaps the single best exercise to strengthen the glutes&nbsp;for hip extension (<a href=\"https://scholar.valpo.edu/cus/919/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>). The glutes are primary movers in both the deadlift and squat, strengthening them vital for performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rep scheme: 4 sets x 8-10 reps</p>\r\n<h4><strong>2) CHIN-UP:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The chin-up will address two factors missing from the first three days; vertical pulling and arm flexion. Vertical pulling is one of the bodies primary movements which should be included in any program for symmetry.</p>\r\n<p>While there are no pulling movements in powerlifting, a strong back is still necessary for stabilization in the squat and deadlift. Still, the lats are even used in the bench press. The last point is it allows full range of motion at the elbow to strengthen the biceps.</p>\r\n<p>Rep scheme: 4x8-10</p>\r\n<p><em>Related:&nbsp;<a title=\"pullup vs chinup\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/pull-ups-vs-chin-ups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pull Up vs Chin Up</a></em></p>\r\n<h4><strong>3) Z-PRESS:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The Z-Press is an&nbsp;<a title=\"overhead press\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/overhead-press-how-to-muscles-worked-benefits-variations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">overhead press</a>&nbsp;that is performed sitting down on the ground. First, this is going to cover your overhead pressing movement which is absent from the first three days.</p>\r\n<p>Secondly, the Z-Press requires significant mobility in the hips, posterior muscles, and thoracic spine. When taken all together, the Z-Press is going to:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n<li>Improve pressing strength</li>\r\n<li>Increase hip mobility</li>\r\n<li>Increase thoracic spine and upper back mobility</li>\r\n<li>Maintain healthy shoulders&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Rep scheme: 3X8-10&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>4) BENT-OVER BARBELL ROW OR KROC ROW:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The primary purpose of these is to add a horizontal pulling movement. You can choose either a barbell row or&nbsp;<a title=\"what are kroc rows\" href=\"https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/kroc-rows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kroc rows</a>. While Kroc rows are usually done with higher reps, you&rsquo;ll just stick with 2x8-10. You will only do 2 sets of these, so get in, get them done, and move on.</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme: 2x8-10</p>\r\n<h4><strong>5) ROLLING TRICEPS EXTENSION:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>As mentioned, the triceps are a prime mover in the bench press. Therefore, it makes sense to give them a little extra attention. For this, you are going to use the rolling triceps extension.</p>\r\n<p>The rolling triceps extension to regular laying dumbbell triceps extensions is what the Kroc row is to dumbbell rows; it\'s a bigger, meaner version. When you perform the rolling version, you allow your arms to come back over your head and then powerfully come forward. This allows extra momentum to thrust a heavier weight up with arm extension.</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme 2X12-15</p>\r\n<h4><strong>6) BICEP CURLS:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The main purpose of this is to add more strength to the muscle of the biceps as well as the tendons and ligaments of the joint. It&rsquo;s essential to keep this area strong and healthy to help prevent injury, especially during the deadlift, where biceps injuries can happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what curl you use, hammer curl, rope attachment, EZ-bar curl; just choose one that&rsquo;s comfortable and do it.</p>\r\n<p>Rep Scheme 2X12-15</p>\r\n<h4><strong>7) LEG CURLS AND EXTENSIONS:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>These are here simply to help strengthen the quadriceps and hamstrings.

The whole warmup should last 10-15 minutes, and then it\'s time to get to your powerlifting routine!</p>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<h2><strong>GET READY TO SEE YOUR STRENGTH JUMP WITH OUR POWERLIFTING PROGRAM</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Now all you have to do is train hard. The best powerlifting programs are guaranteed to improve your performance as long as you follow the guidelines.</p>\r\n<p>Remember, progressive overload is key to making gains. In addition, the &ldquo;Strength Session&rdquo; should be your hardest day. The other sessions require intensity and work but should not fatigue you.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s up to you which days of the week you workout and which you rest. You have 4 powerlifting workouts per week&nbsp;and&nbsp;3 rest days, and make sure you avoid going too hard on Session 4, which is your accessory day.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, remember the importance of deloading weeks, which occurs every 4th week in this powerlifting program. While this applies mainly to the strength movement, do not go extra hard on the other movements either. You can even lighten up on those as well.</p>\r\n<p>With a deload week every 4th week in this powerlifting plan, you can continue this program for as long as you are seeing good results. There is no set amount of time. If you want to build strength and power, you can run this until you start seeing diminishing returns (i.e. 3-12 months) or when you just want to start something fresh.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The sport of powerlifting is relatively simple and&nbsp;your powerlifting program should be too.&nbsp;Keep it simple, train with intensity, add more weight, and be consistent.&nbsp;Go get started.</p>\r\n<p><em>Looking for more great routines to build your strength?
